## Camera Calibration

Use the following calibration pattern to calibrate your camera (calculate intrinsic camera parameters and distortion). On android smartphones you can use the App CameraCal.
Don't forget to choose the correct resolution (! you have to calibrate your camera for each resolution, if you want to use more than one).

The following intrinsic camera parameters will be calculated:  
* f_x and f_y (camera focal length)
